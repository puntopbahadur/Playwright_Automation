This project involves functional testing using Python Playwright on the OrangeHRM free, open-source HR Management web application.
My tests include logging in, adding an employee, and uploading the employee's profile picture.

Installation Dependencies
-------------------------
1. Install the Pytest plugin for Playwright, which provides the necessary integration:
-> pip install pytest-playwright
2. After installing the Python package, install the web browsers (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit) that Playwright uses for testing:
-> playwright install
